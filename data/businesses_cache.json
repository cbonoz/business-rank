After structuring a huge real estate acquisition deal while working for a private equity firm in NYC, Eric took his buy out and RCG was born.  Continuing a tradition of representing business principals the way we would want to be represented, RCG does not collect arbitrary fees or mass listings just to appear busy.  In fact, we are very selective about the businesses we select for representation.  RCG is different.... we don't compete in any category, we create our own category!",
