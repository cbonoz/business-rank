                    "introduction": "With 28+ years in the mortgage industry and over $1B in closed loans, I specialize in helping clients navigate complex lending scenarios—especially self-employed borrowers and business owners with unique financials. I've worked as a loan officer, branch manager, and business owner, and I bring clarity, strategy, and personal service to every transaction.\r\nI have deep experience working with small business owners and self-employed clients, understanding the intricate nuances of tax returns, income documentation, and the creative structuring often needed to get deals done. Whether it's analyzing K-1s, navigating write-offs, or leveraging bank statement programs, I know how to present your full financial picture in the best light.\r\nOut of the office, I’ve spent 18 years as the head football coach at Scituate High School, winning 3 state championships (2018, 2021, 2024) and helping 100+ players reach college programs. Leadership and results drive everything I do—whether in the business world or on the sidelines. I've also started and continue to run Scituate Flag Football for the past 12 years.  We currently serve multiple communities on the South Shore.\r\nBased in Scituate, MA with my wife Kelly (my college sweetheart) and our six amazing kids — five daughters and one son.",
